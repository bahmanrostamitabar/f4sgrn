It aims to tackle real problems in any type of organisations that prioritised the wellbeing of people and the society as a whole towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals prioritising social foundations and ecological ceilling. It helps managers in domains such as health, humanitarian, public and third sector to improve their practices in using forecasting to support the decision-making system. Evidence from the first and second workshops on F4SG indicated that less attention has been given to research on forecasting for social good in comparison to other areas of forecasting. To address this issue, we organise a special issue of the IJF. The purpose of the special issue is to attract high quality papers that are concerned with forecasting for social good. Both papers on academic forecasting research and applications in forecasting practice are welcome. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n Health and healthcare Humanitarian operations Disaster relief Climate change Environment and Wildlife Sustainability Education Public welfare Fraud, collusion, and corruption Government Public safety and security Poverty \u0026amp; Inequality Social services Wellbeing  Submission deadline : 31 December 2021\nGuidelines\n Submit your paper\n Instructions for authors\n  All papers will follow IJF’s double-blind refereeing process.

Barriers to broadening the base of beneficiaries are identified, and some parallels are drawn with similar concerns that were expressed in the Operational Research literature some years ago. A recent initiative, called `Democratising Forecasting`, is discussed, highlighting its achievements, challenges, limitations and future agenda. Communication issues between the major forecasting stakeholders are also examined, with pointers being given for more effective communications, in order to gain the greatest benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Forecasting and its Beneficiaries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rostami-Tabar Bahman","Ali M.

Despite a considerable body of research in the area of forecasting, the focus has largely been on the financial and economic outcomes of the forecasting process as opposed to societal benefits. Our motivation in this study is to promote the latter, with a view to using the forecasting process to advance social and environmental objectives such as equality, social justice and sustainability. We refer to such forecasting practices as Forecasting for Social Good (FSG) where the benefits to society and the environment take precedence over economic and financial outcomes. We conceptualise FSG and discuss its scope and boundaries in the context of the `Doughnut theory`. We present some key attributes that qualify a forecasting process as FSG: it is concerned with a real problem; it is focused on advancing social and environmental goals and prioritises these over conventional measures of economic success; and it has a broad societal impact. We also position FSG in the wider literature on forecasting and social good practices. We propose an FSG maturity framework as the means to engage academics and practitioners with research in this area. Finally, we highlight that FSG: (i) cannot be distilled to a prescriptive set of guidelines, (ii) is scalable, and (iii) has the potential to make significant contributions to advancing social objectives.","tags":null,"title":"Forecasting for Social Good","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Conference"],"content":"   1 Important dates: 2 Publications: 3 Keynote speakers: 4 Organisers: 5 About FSG workshop   We are now accepting abstracts for oral and poster presentation at the 2nd International Workshop on Forecasting for Social Good sponsored by the International Institute of Forecasters.

Furthermore, the research on forecasting for social good has been relatively slow and sporadic, both in academic publications and practical applications. The goal of this workshop is thus to improve the research and practice in issues related to forecasting for social good by: facilitating interactions between practitioners, researchers, and policy makers to develop a cohesive and sustainable network of international collaborations with a focus on issues related to forecasting for social good; promoting the development of new methodology and metrics to address the specific challenges related to forecasting for social good; providing professional development to policy makers; gaining a better understanding of the available data, challenges in data acquisition, and the uncertainty present in the data used to produce forecasts; and, addressing the ethical issues related to the use of forecasting methods for problems that impact society.\n ","date":1578873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578873600,"objectID":"c0cfa52227d541ff82da6347a132d005","permalink":"/post/cfp-fsg/","publishdate":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cfp-fsg/","section":"post","summary":"A guide to call for paper submission for forecasting for social good workshop","tags":["IIF","forecasting"],"title":"F4SG workshop - Call for abstract Submissions","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"/contact/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"A little more about us and how to get in touch","tags":null,"title":"About","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"65de3680a280f6bf29dc34fe1adad5a6","permalink":"/talks/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/","section":"","summary":"Upcoming and recent F4SG Learning Labs","tags":null,"title":"F4SG Learning Labs","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"/projects/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"See some of the projects I have worked on","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"/about/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"A little more about me and how to get in touch","tags":null,"title":"Resume","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My blog posts are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n   ","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"53e892b8b41cc4caece1cfd5ef21d6e7","permalink":"/license/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/license/","section":"","summary":"My blog posts are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n   ","tags":null,"title":"LICENSE: CC-BY-SA","type":"page"}]
