## Who is the training for?

* Anyone who is interested in electricity demand forecasting research and practice, from simple baseline methods to advanced machine learning techniques;
 
* A decision maker who wants to learn how these forecasts can be used in decision making and the tradeoffs of modeling approaches;

* An academic or graduate student that wants to expand their understanding of the state of the art with a hands-on session;

* Practitioners in the field who are looking for ways to improve their data-driven forecasting.

## What participants will learn in the training?
 
Participants will be able to:

* Identify modeling approaches and their use in practice;

* Distinguish a diverse set of challenges in forecasting electricity demand at multiple scales and how these relate to decision making processes;

* Recognize research directions and better identify numerous sources of open-source electricity datasets;

* Leverage software for modeling, data acquisition and processing, and evaluation.


## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of Python or a high-level programming language.

* Basic knowledge of statistics and statistical modeling
