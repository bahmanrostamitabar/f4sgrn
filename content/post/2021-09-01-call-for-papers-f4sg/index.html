<p>Forecasting for Social Good (F4SG) aims to explore and expose how (where) forecasting can create positive societal benefits. It aims to tackle real problems in any type of organisations that prioritised the wellbeing of people and the society as a whole towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals prioritising social foundations and ecological ceilling. It helps managers in domains such as health, humanitarian, public and third sector to improve their practices in using forecasting to support the decision-making system.
Evidence from the first and second workshops on <a href="https://www.f4sg.org/services/workshop/">F4SG</a> indicated that less attention has been given to research on forecasting for social good in comparison to other areas of forecasting. To address this issue, we organise a special issue of the IJF. The purpose of the special issue is to attract high quality papers that are concerned with forecasting for social good. Both papers on academic forecasting research and applications in forecasting practice are welcome. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health and healthcare</li>
<li>Humanitarian operations</li>
<li>Disaster relief</li>
